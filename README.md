# Project #3 - STA2453 (Winter 2020)

The assignment and starter code for project #3 is available here.

The full assignment is [available in the Jupyter notebook - STA2453_project3.ipynb](STA2453_project3-ver1.ipynb). R sample code to access the Numina API is [available in numina-student.Rmd](project3-R/numina-student.Rmd) (preview the file [here](project3-R/numina-student.md)), but is missing some of the assignment details.

## Mandatory Project Workflow

- Each student clones the assignment repository from Github to their local machine, and **starts a unique branch** to work on their part of the assignment.


- Students work on their branches, committing changes and pushing their branch to the shared repository.


- When each student finishes their part of the assignment, they start a pull request.


- Each group works together to review the proposed changes, discuss improvements or alternatives, and resolve conflicting changes arising from concurrent development.


- When the students agree on a resolution, they merge each pull request.  The teaching team can leave feedback on commits or pull requests if they are tagged in the comments. 


- Both members of the team should contribute equally to building the web page and documentation.  It's not appropriate for one member to work on building the web page and the other to work on the documentation.
